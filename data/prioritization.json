Il existe une loi sur l’emblème, d'après le plan stratégique de la SN. \nLa Société Nationale du CRCo en tant qu’auxiliaire des pouvoirs publics dans le domaine de l’humanitaire intervient régulièrement et de façon très active dans les situations d’urgence aux côtés de l’Etat comorien, conformément à son rôle bien défini dans le Plan National de Préparation et de Réponse aux Urgences de l’Union des Comores. Le Croissant-Rouge Comorien intervient dans les secteurs d’eau et assainissement, secours et santé, abris temporaires et la distribution des produits de première nécessité et du Cash transfert. Mais ceci ne se reflète pas dans un mandat officiel. Dès la création de la plateforme PIROI en 2000, le CRCo est devenu membre à part entière. Il a été reconnu par le CICR en septembre 2005.\nParfois le rôle d'auxiliaire aux pouvoirs publics sur CRCo est mal compris par les autorités surtout sur la GRC. Le CRCo est même parfois vu comme un concurrent potentiel. La connaissance du rôle du CRCo se perd au niveau des autorités car le personnel change souvent.\nIl n’existe pas de mandat officiel avec une valeur juridique qui décrit clairement le rôle du CRCo au niveau communautaire et en urgence.\nUne mission avec la FICR fin octobre 2024 a permis d'élaborer une ébauche de convention de partenariat avec la DGSC. La signature est prévue la semaine du 11/11/24 en présence de la FICR. La convention aura besoin d'être diffusée une fois signée.\nLe plan stratégique est régi par les valeurs et Principes du Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge. Des stratégies existent, la volonté est là de diffuser jusqu'aux volontaires, mais en réalité il n’y a pas de diffusion et le changement des ressources humaines (volontaires et staff) fait que la compréhension est limitée.\nPas de responsable au sein de la SN qui fait la promotion du DIH auprès des autorités publiques. Mais la promotion des Principes et Valeurs Humanitaires se fait lorsqu'il y a de grands évènements. \nPour les épidémies, la stratégie CRCo 2021-2025 inclut un axe stratégique intitulé \"Amélioration de la santé des vulnérables\" dans lequel s'inscrit l'objectif de réduire l'impact des maladies et des urgences de santé publique, notamment le nombre de morts et de cas de maladies.\nCe rôle de la SN est connu des partenaires mais aucun cadre juridique ne l'indique. C'est même une demande du DG santé au niveau de l'Etat qui veut inclure le CRCo officiellement.\nLa SN n'a pas un engagement à long terme pour une politique environnementale des programmes et interventions.",

Les volontaires actifs reçoivent aussi des gilets. Il n’y a pas de parcours d'apprentissage dont les volontaires prennent connaissance dès leur admission au CRCo. Pas de formation de base non plus sur le Mouvement et les attentes. En urgence, les volontaires spontanés ne sont pas informés sur un minimum de notions (Principes fondamentaux, réactions inacceptables, etc.) et donc des incidents peuvent survenir et sont un risque sur l’image du CRCo. Pas d'analyse spécifique sur l’accès sécurisé. Pas de formations sur la protection, l'abus et le genre. En Janvier 2024, les volontaires ont reçu pour la première fois une formation sur la sureté et la sécurité mais il n'existe pas de procédures pour que les bureaux régionaux prennent les décisions de façon autonome sur la sécurité de leurs équipes. Les mesures de protection (même en cas d’épidémies) se limitent aux EPI. Il n’existe pas de point focal pour suivre cela non plus.\nDes termes de référence sont préparés pour la mobilisation des volontaires durant les réponses d’urgence car c’est généralement une exigence reliée aux fonds. Il n’existe pas de signe d’institutionnalisation de cette procédure au cas où la SN agit hors lignes budgétaires. \nLes volontaires sont couverts par l’assurance de la FICR (qui ne couvrent pas les épidémies). Le code de conduite n’est pas connu ni signé par le staff et les volontaires. Les dépenses des volontaires ne sont remboursées que s’il y a un DREF qui se déclenche.\nIl n’existe pas de base de données effective, digitale, pour gérer les volontaires sur base de leurs formations. Toutefois, des annexes existent dans le plan de contingence « Inondations » et notamment une cartographie des BDRT dans les 3 branches.\nDans les branches, les bases de données sont faites en forme de registre sur papier et de listes reliées aux formations. Même si les listes se capitalisent aussi sur Excel, les données utilisées en réalité sont sur papier. Les capacités en IT dans les branches doivent être renforcées.\nIl y a deux ans, un projet avec la CR Française avait proposé de renseigner une base de données numérique, mais le PF n'avait pas le temps de suivre le travail et donc celui-ci s’est arrêté. Un nouveau point focal a été nommé en vue de suivre le renseignement et l’activation de l’usage des bases de données.\nPour les interventions, la SN appelle tous les volontaires disponibles à se mobiliser. Ceci permet d’avoir des capacités multisectorielles mais vu que de nombreux volontaires sont motivés, leur gestion devient difficile et des frustrations se créent lorsque les coordinateurs demandent à quelques volontaires de quitter les lieux (exemple 300 sur place alors que le besoin est de 20 volontaires).\nDes procédures existent pour activer, déployer et gérer les BDRT et NDRT mais pas de procédures ni de fonds propres permettant d’augmenter (recrutement, rétention) ou de diminuer le personnel pendant les urgences.\nPas de stratégie formelle de rotation et de rétention du personnel durant les interventions. Des notions sont inclues dans le règlement intérieur mais ne sont pas spécifiques aux urgences.\nPas de formations sur les soins auto-administrés, la violence et le harcèlement au travail et le soutien psychosocial pendant et après les urgences et les crises. La formation sur la prévention et le contrôle des épidémies se fait uniquement au niveau des volontaires mobilisables (équipes d'intervention BDRT et NDRT).",

Il n’existe pas de politique et de directives pour l’utilisation des réseaux sociaux.\nIl y a une stratégie de mobilisation des ressources qui est écrite et validée mais elle n’est pas mise en œuvre (les facilitateurs ne l'ont pas reçue). La SN y a cartographié les différentes possibilités de mobilisation de fonds mais ça ne se fait pas en pratique. Il n’y a pas un point focal qui gère la mobilisation des ressources. Le lien qui existe sur le site pour les dons en ligne ne fonctionne pas. Le téléphone existe mais les partenaires et le public ne connaissent pas le numéro. Des personnes à l'internationnal ne peuvent pas faire des dons en ligne les premières 48h après l’impact. \nPour l’instant, la possibilité pour le Croissant Rouge Comorien de lever rapidement des fonds en situation d’urgence est de déclencher les mécanismes de Crisis Modifier et de DREF. Le point focal DREF est Siradji (PF projet PIROI). Les responsables des secteurs travaillent sur leurs propres parties.\nLes accords cadre avec des donateurs se limite à l’accord avec la PIROI : l'accord de Saint Denis pour la sortie de Stocks d'urgence, la préparation et la mobilisation des ERU. La SN ne mobilise pas de ressources pour ses activités de préparation (auprès du secteur privé ou autre). Les programmes de préparation qui se font au cours de l’année sont planifiés avec la PIROI. \nLa SN n'a pas de fond propre à utiliser en urgence, avec des critères d'utilisation adéquats. Le département finance s’occupe de faire le rapport sur les dépenses et sur les possibles changements reliés à l’usage des fonds.\nIl n’existe pas de liste prédéfinie de dons en nature acceptables, avec une façon d'atténuer les risques d'image ou de réputation. Et l’atténuation des fraudes se fait au niveau de la finance, à travers les procédures de demandes d'avance et les limites budgétaires après lesquelles le paiement doit être fait à travers la banque.  \nDurant les épidémies, les partenaires potentiels qui peuvent fournir des dons en nature sont : la PIROI et l'UNICEF\nLa résolution des problèmes environnementaux dans la gestion des catastrophes n'est pas encore une considération de la SN.",
